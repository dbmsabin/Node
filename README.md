# Node.js Practice Repository

This repository contains my Node.js backend practice code.  
I’m using it to learn how backend applications work, how APIs are built, and how to structure Node.js projects properly.

Most of the code here is written while learning, testing ideas, and improving my understanding step by step.

## Tech Used

- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB (Mongoose)  
- JavaScript  
- REST APIs  

## What This Repo Includes

This repository covers things like:

- Setting up an Express server  
- Creating routes and controllers  
- Basic REST API structure  
- CRUD operations  
- Connecting Node.js with MongoDB  
- Handling requests and responses  
- Using environment variables with `.env`  
- Organizing files in a cleaner way as I learn  

Some parts are simple, and some may be refactored later as I learn better ways to do things.

## Project Status

This is a learning repository.  
The code is not meant to be perfect or production-ready. I update and improve it as I learn new concepts.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js  
- npm  
- MongoDB (local or cloud)  

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbmsabin/Node.git
